# Task
<describe task>

# Instructions
1. Explore and read through the code base paying close attention to <areas to pay close attention to>. Use sub-agents to investigate any questions you have or any areas of the code base you'd like to learn more about.
2. Think about would would need to be changed in order to acomplish the todoist page navigation described in the task above. Use sub-agents to review your design. Do not write any code at this stage.
3. Present your design to me and wait for me to explicitly approve it.
4. Follow a test-driven development approach to implement your design.
   1. Implement the tests for your design
   2. Use sub-agents to run your tests
   3. Commit your changes once I've indicated I'm happy with them.
   4. Write code that passes your tests. Do not modify the tests. Use independent sub-agents to verify that your implementation isn't overfitting to your tests.
5. Present your implementation to me. Wait for my approval.
6. Write up a summary of your implementation to `file-name.md` to help with the review process.
